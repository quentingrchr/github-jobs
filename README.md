# Frontend Mentor - GitHub Jobs API

![Design preview for the GitHub Jobs API coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

[Demo](https://coming-soon)

## Description

This project was inspired by a Frontend Mentor challenge. The challenge was to built out a jobs board using the [GitHub Jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/api) data and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- View all jobs currently live on the GitHub Jobs API
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## Dependencies

For this project I chose to start with a basic create-next-app boilerplate. On top of that I added

- styled-components
- styled-reset
- polished
- axios

## Dev Mode

Clone the project and run the following commands

```
cd github-jobs
```

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn dev
```
